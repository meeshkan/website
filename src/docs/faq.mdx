# Frequently asked questions

You asked and we answered! In this section, we'll dig into the questions we've received most often about Meeshkan.

**Questions answered:**

- [What is property-based testing?](#what-is-property-based-testing)
- [Why are my tests taking so long?](#why-are-my-tests-taking-so-long)
- [Where can I see the results of my tests?](#where-can-i-see-the-results-of-my-tests)

## What is property-based testing?

Property-based testing is a generative approach to software testing. This means that instead of writing out exact values to test, the input values are _automatically_ generated based on designated properties. By generating thousands (or even millions) of test cases, we're able to find bugs we never could've imagined.

It's not a replacement for traditional techniques, but we're fans of property-based testing because it excels [where example-based testing lacks](/blog/property-based-testing-python/#limitations-of-example-based-testing).

If you're interested in learning more, we've published a [beginner's guide to property-based testing](/blog/property-based-testing-python/) on our blog.

## Why are my tests taking so long?

Property-based testing is very resource-intensive. During the alpha release, we've found that tests can take anywhere from 2-7 hours. Soon, we'll be offering paid plans with options to speed up this testing time. [Let us know](/contact/) if that sounds like something you'd sign up for.

## Where can I see the results of my tests?

The results of your tests are submitted as [issues to your repository](/docs/#how-meeshkan-reports-bugs). By default, the Meeshkan GitHub bot will file a separate issue for every potential bug found. If no bugs are found, you won't hear anything from us.

We're currently working on a new Meeshkan web application, as well as branch checks. Both of these will show visual feedback and individual reports for your tests.
