# Test Runs are picking up the pace 🏃

![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76995637/114603491-12d76480-9c98-11eb-908e-58f8efab88a1.png)

After some minor tweaks, we're proud to share the Test Runner `beta` with **all** Meeshkan users! Now it only takes 1 click to turn a User Story into a Test Case, and they'll run _daily_ against your staging environment.

That's **1 click** to write tests, run tests, and analyse test outcomes 😱

Used together with [Test Case exports](/blog/how-to-puppeteer-jest-github-action/), you can comprehensively and rapidly test your **entire** UI.

<a
	onClick={() => {
		window.Intercom("showMessages")
	}}
>
	Need a hand setting it up?
</a>

### Here's everything else we've been up to in the last cycle:

- Enuring that Test Runs are triggered only when a staging URL and Test Cases exist.
- Video creation for all failed tests in the Test Runner
- Test Runner respects `isAuthenticated`, and only authenticates if necessary for the Test Case
- Script and Chrome extension refactoring for performance and type safety
- [Chrome extension update](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meeshkan-recorder/cfjdddhjecoeahjkmegbkakfpppflmgo?hl=en) has pretty rounded corners 🤗 (this will update automatically, no need to re-install)
- Added `mixBlendMode` to the ghost buttons in light mode to make them visible.
- Added a skeleton table that displays while User Stories are loading
- Added the ability to turn on/off Test Runs (_Settings_ > _Details_)

#### Fixes:

- **Now, recording the log-in flow is fast and smooth.** Before, recording the log-in flow manually occasionally did not correctly register as an authenticated flow.
- **Now, scrolling is natural and consistent across all screen sizes and devices.** Before, on smaller screens and on mobile, there were some CSS and scrolling bugs in settings and the sidebar.
