### Another fun thing â€” HUGE ðŸ’ƒ Performance upgrades _everywhere_!

Following from the upgrades to our recording script last week, we've made some system-wide improvements to both frontend and backend elements that **decrease loading times by 10x** and **improve the performance your webapp** if the script is installed.

**Here's the magic that made it happen:**

- We merged our "mutation observer diff" that continues to improve script performance (and developed our own **custom library** in the process!)
- Improvements in type-safety and integrity of the data pipeline
- More groups of user flows are being created due to a larger window of data in context
- User Story steps appear instantly after a Chrome extension recording is completed
- Fixed bug that added quotation marks to certain string values

**Here's everything else we've been up to in the last week:**

- To ensure that User Stories usefully illustrate how your software is used, we've filtered out rare events, so that the ones with less than 1 flow aren't shown in the User Story menu.
- Resize events have been added to User Stories
- Step numbers in User Stories bring clarity to the flow of actions

**Fixes:**

- **Now, graceful failure ðŸŽ© when a drag and drop doesn't have destination coordinates.** No more scary error screens!
- **Now, new releases to the Meeshkan Recorder Chrome extension update automatically.** Before, scripts were cached, preventing automatic updates.
- **Now, just receive relevant notifications from the Meeshkan Recorder.** Before, there was a bug for Windows users that sent them repeat notifications.
