# Test now, test in an hour‚Ä¶ test whenever you want!

Manually trigger test runs whenever you want, allowing you to always ensure that your next merge will be a success.

### Here's everything else we've been up to in the last cycle:

- Now videos show click locations by showing an svg at the click coordinates üåü
- For those out there with the console always open, you‚Äôll see less console errors
- We ensured that Meeshkan won‚Äôt impact the performance of your webapp, by implementing a ‚Äúkill-switch‚Äù for the recorder script for when computing power is needed to load your DOM
- We started work on the latest version of the Chrome extension (with floating recording controls ‚òÅÔ∏è)‚Ä¶ watch this space!

#### Fixes:

- **Now**, more test cases reach completion. **Before**, some users experienced test cases hanging.
- **Now**, longer User Stories will have videos and generate faster. **Before**, long User Stories would take a while to generate, and sometimes fail to.
