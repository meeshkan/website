# Test Runner in stealth mode ü•∑
You can already run tests you create from User Stories by [exporting Test Cases as Puppeteer scripts](https://meeshkan.com/blog/how-to-puppeteer-jest-github-action/) but we're also working to allow you to run them directly from within Meeshkan, and we've made some big strides in bringing that to life this cycle. <a onClick={() => {window.Intercom("showMessages")}}>Get in touch</a> to get early access!

If you've installed the recording script in your webapp, the User Stories generated by your actual users just got supercharged ‚ö°Ô∏è 
After working on the accuracy of User Stories in our last release, we're now tuning the algorithms to **produce more Stories** that you can turn into Test Cases. 
You can now clearly distinguish the **Log-in flow, authenticated flows, and unauthenticated flows** too, with handy tags in the _Recordings_ table.
We've also **increased the accuracy of the video that's generated** to give you the most accurate possible representation of how your users interact with your app. 
On top of that, **all videos are generated automatically**, and playable directly from the _Recordings_ table. 


### Here's everything else we've been up to in the last week:
- Increased accuracy of User Story videos by making video generation events more explicit
- You can now clearly distinguish the log-in flow, authenticated flows, and unauthenticated flows too, with handy tags in the _Recordings_ table.
- Videos are generated automatically for **all** User Stories
- Started using the Puppeteer script to test the Meeshkan webapp with user-generated User Stories by setting up the GitHub action
- Improved the output of the downloadable script
  - Formatting improvements
  - Insert the defined cookie by default
  - Change dragndrop events to click events if they have the same coordinates

ü§´ Test Runner Beta
  - Shows the step that failed and why
  - Adds the dynamic test details
  - Links back to the user story

### Fixes:
- **Now, script tags show correctly on the dashboard.** Before, script tags didn't correctly show, dependent on if you'd received events or not.
- **Now, no more unwanted console errors** Before, vigilant users will have noticed some strange lines in the console ‚Äì they're there no longer üôÖ
- **Now, no more repeated reloads** Before, there was a reload every time you navigated back to a Meeshkan tab after moving away from it.
