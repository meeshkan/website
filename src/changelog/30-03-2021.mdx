# Test Runner in stealth mode ðŸ¥·

You can already run tests you create from User Stories by [exporting Test Cases as Puppeteer scripts](https://meeshkan.com/blog/how-to-puppeteer-jest-github-action/) but we're also working to allow you to run them directly from within Meeshkan, and we've made some big strides in bringing that to life this cycle. <a onClick={() => {window.Intercom("showMessages")}}>Get in touch</a> to get early access!

#### Here's everything else we've been up to in the last cycle:

- Increased accuracy of User Story videos by making video generation events more explicit
- You can now clearly distinguish the log-in flow, authenticated flows, and unauthenticated flows too, with handy tags in the _Recordings_ table

- Videos are generated automatically for **all** User Stories
- Started using the Puppeteer script to test the Meeshkan webapp with user-generated User Stories by setting up the GitHub action
- Improved the output of the downloadable script
  - Formatting improvements
  - Insert the defined cookie by default
  - Change dragndrop events to click events if they have the same coordinates to make things cleaner!
- The ðŸ¤« Test Runner `beta` changes include:
  - Showing the step that failed, and why
  - Adding the dynamic test details (which element could not be found)
  - Links back to the user story
  - Fixes bug where test outcomes had a longer timeout than the test run causing uncompleted runs



#### Fixes:

- **Now, script tags show correctly on the dashboard.** Before, script tags didn't correctly show, dependent on if you'd received events or not.
- **Now, no more repeated reloads** Before, there was a reload every time you navigated back to a Meeshkan tab after moving away from it.
