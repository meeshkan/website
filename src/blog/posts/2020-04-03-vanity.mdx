<br />

After searching for a way to gather weekly analytics on GitHub repositories and coming empty handed, we decided to build our own solution. So, we developed [VANITY](https://vanity.dev).

VANITY sends you a weekly email with a list of your repositories. Each repo is captioned with its latest metrics and a comparison to the previous week's performance.

## How it works

The entire project is open source and you can check out the [source code on VANITY's GitHub repo](https://github.com/meeshkan/vanity).

It is powered by the following dependencies and technologies (in no particular order):

- Queue managemenet by [Bull](https://optimalbits.github.io/bull/)
- Job persistence with [Heroku Redis](https://www.heroku.com/redis)
- Emails sent with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
- Email templates using [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
- Database models using [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/)
- Database tables stored in [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)
- Hosting on [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/)
- Web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- CSS design with [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)
- Error management with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)

## Roadmap

There's a lot more that we want to add to VANITY. Here are a few of our ideas:

- Support for organization repositories
- More metrics (such as number of _opened/closed issues_, _opened/closed pull requests_, and _commits_)
- Daily emails

You can keep track of the things we're working on at the [VANITY GitHub repository](https://github.com/meeshkan/vanity/issues).
