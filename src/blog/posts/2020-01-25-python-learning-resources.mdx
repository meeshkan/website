Earlier this week, I learned that I'll be working less on [unmock-js](https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js) and more our latest open-source namesake, [Meeshkan](https://github.com/meeshkan/meeshkan). The main difference? Meeshkan is written in Python... which I've never used before 🙀

So [I asked folks on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carolstran/status/1220310112356773888?s=20) for their favorite Python resources and gathered them into a little list (in no particular order). Enjoy!
