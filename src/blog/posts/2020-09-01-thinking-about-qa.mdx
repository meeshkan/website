At a conference recently, I heard someone ask the question "When's a good time to start thinking about QA?" The question was asked in earnest, but the speaker responded with a quick "Immediately!" and moved onto the next question. While "Immediately!" reflected the speaker's enthusiasm about quality assurance, it left the question-asker down in the dumps.

Knowing when to think about QA is _really hard_, and there's not that much good advice out there. A lot of blog posts, like the above-mentioned speaker, skirt the issue by saying things like "write more tests" or "use strong typing." Chances are, if you're Googling "When to start thinking about QA", these are not answers to your question. This article _is_.

## A couple definitions

Once, when I was building an Android app, an angry supervisor asked us to "Stop throwing the app over the net to QA." I understood what the person meant, and I've heard this sort of critique a lot. The issue with the critique is that the most important part of the QA process _is_ throwing your app over the net. The reason you throw your app over the net is because, very soon, you will be throwing your app over an even bigger net called production.

I like to use the analogy of the performing arts here: there are lots of rehearsals where you bring in someone from outside to look at your work. The last rehearsal (the dress rehearsal) is almost always this, but there are regular points in the development of a staged production where you'll bring in a trusted expert to give their opinion. You do this because, eventually, there will be hundreds and thousands of people forming their own opinion about your work, and it's important to make sure that your work represents your ideas. When you collaborate with a QA engineer, you're bringing someone in to watch a rehearsal.

A lot of people worry that QA engineers will treat every rehearsal like the dress rehearsal, but this is not true. Great QA engineers know exactly what stage a project or feature is at and will give feedback that will help the project or feature _at that stage_.

So to sum up, QA is a third-party viewpoint that gives you stage-appropriate technical feedback about your project.

## The single most important step

The most important step you can take, starting today, is kicking off a relationship with a QA professional or a company providing QA. This does not require purchasing or using a service - it just means introducing yourself.

Great QA services (and we like to think we're building one!) know how to take it from here. Like a tailor or a doctor, they will start taking measures. By monitoring a codebase, a roadmap, and specs, a QA professional will focus on the following questions:

- When are major releases planned?
- Are there any indicators that would predict increased development velocity at a given time?
- How often are there breaking changes to a service, and what are the precursors to these changes?

These questions are asked in order to plan out when their help can be most impactful and necessary.

At Meeshkan, we ask and answer these questions by testing code bases, creating specs, and building burn charts. The purpose of this is not to provide you with information (you're already overloaded!) but to answer even more important questions:

- When will the team likely have time to digest test reports?
- Are there enough valuable indicators about quality to share them with the team?
- What is a five-alarm fire in the context of the team's business needs?

All of this means that, when you get a ping from us, you can trust us that it is important. Of course, we give you access to the entire trail that leads up to our decisions, and if you really want to, you can read over the tens of thousands of tests we run on your service. But our job is knowing _what_ to present to you, _when_ to present it, and _how_ it should be presented.

So, [introduce yourself](./). Say hi. It will take a matter of minutes, and you'll be on the path to cultivating a long-term relationship that underpins great QA.

## The next step

You've now won half the battle. Developing a relationship with a QA professional will aleviate a lot of stress because your trusted partner knows when to step in and when to get out of the way.

The next step, and the other half of the battle, is what happens at the "rehearsal", to use the analogy from above. What are you hoping to get out of it that you wouldn't get out of writing a few unit tests or using stronger typing?

QA is all about business outcomes: it puts itself in the place of the user, looks at the current state of the UX, and assesses if the "diff" between the current UX and the desired UX is on track. If a QA engineer crashes your app by pressing a button five times in rapid succession, they won't elevate the crash unless it is linked to an underlying problem that can affect business outcomes.

We see this all the time at Meeshkan - our algorithms regularly crash servers with very large numbers, negative pagination and other forms of exotic input. If you hear about it from us on a top-level report, it is because we've linked the crashes to some underlying behavior that we think is unsustainable. Otherwise, you won't hear from us because _it's ok if your app crashes in the wild_. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! What's not OK is for your business to consistently only ever return three out of twenty valid search results to a user. That's not a crash, but if search is a critical feature of your business, then that's a major problem. Great QA brings that to the fore.

The difference between Meeshkan and traditional manual QA is that we do this automatically. There are several core benefits of automated QA:

- a
- b
- c

What automated QA is _not_ a replacement for is manual QA. Someone will always need to give your app or service a spin in the wild. But automated QA leads naturally to manual QA in several respects:

- a
- b
- c

## Conclusion

The purpose of this article, and why it is a bit longer than your average missive on the subject, is to avoid a kitch or cop-out answer to "When should I start thinking about QA?" It explores this question head on, addressing the purpose of QA, the benefits you can expect, the costs to anticipate and how to kick things off.

As businesses increasingly find themselves pivoting to keep up with market tendencies, the major challenge of the next decade will not be making software that's built to last. It will be honing in on market signals faster than competitors. Your software is the _best_ signal detector there is, and modern quality assurance makes sure that what you are building will return as much signal and as little noise as possible. At Meeshkan, we accompany teams that build modern software. So what are you building? [Let us know](./)!
