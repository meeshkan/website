# How Meeshkan works

Testing is the core of what Meeshkan does and it's important that we're transparent about how it all works. This section covers  some of the Meeshkan fundamentals.

**In this section:**

- [Running the tests](#running-the-tests)
- [Testing frequency](#testing-frequency)
- [Reporting bugs and issues](#reporting-bugs-and-issues)
- [Suggested fixes](#suggested-fixes)

## Running the tests

Meeshkan uses an [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) to understand your project's expected inputs and outputs. This OpenAPI specification provides a framework for Meeshkan to generate test properties. From there, Meeshkan runs [property-based tests](/docs/how-meeshkan-works/#what-is-property-based-testing) on your project.

If you don't already have an OpenAPI specification, we can generate one for you with our [HTTP Mocking Toolkit (HMT)](https://github.com/meeshkan/hmt). HMT collects recordings of server traffic and generates a [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) file based on the logs. It then builds an OpenAPI schema from that file.

## Testing frequency

During the alpha release (which we're in now), Meeshkan will test all registered repositories on a weekly basis. We decided on weekly because property-based testing is very resource-intensive. Not to mention that the volume of bugs discovered in a single run can be significant.

We'll soon be introducing paid plans with options to test repositories more often. If you're interested in this, [let us know](/contact/).

## Reporting bugs and issues

We're currently experimenting with the most effective way to report bugs. By default, Meeshkan [files an issue on the registered repository](/docs/#how-meeshkan-reports-bugs) when it finds a bug. Other options we're exploring include email digests, Slack notifications, and branch checks.

## Suggested fixes

In some cases, Meeshkan is able to suggest a fix for the reported bug. This is a sparse feature at the moment, but it's being actively developed. Please note that, in any case, these are _suggestions_ and not a certain solution to the problem.

Here's an example of what they could look like (anonymized for privacy). The suggestion is the last sentence of the issue description:
