# Introduction

We're stoked you are an early adopter, trying out Meeshkan. Here are some concepts to help you understand what is happening behind the scenes, and what you can expect.

## What Meeshkan does

Meeshkan is a Machine Learning powered API / third-party dependency, testing and mocking tool. Once you install the app, Meeshkan will run on a weekly basis, submitting issues to your repo when bugs are found.

## What happens after installation?

After installation, we'll run property based tests on your repo, weekly. If no bugs were found, you won't hear from us. If we did find a bug, the Meeshkan bot will post an issue to your repo and tag the installer.
