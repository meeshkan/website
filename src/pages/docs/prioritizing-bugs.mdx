# Prioritizing bugs

![Test priority screenshot](https://media.graphcms.com/ze5Y1giBRLm8ryBlHIOG)

As a way to categorize the urgency in which you should approach bugs reported, we now tag priority tests with priority levels.

Being able to analyze the severity of a bug also helps the Meeshkan team decide which notification channel is most appropriate (pager duty vs GitHub issue vs slack vs email).

Security focused bugs although don't prevent a client from operating, often make it unsafe to do so. Meeshkan automatically labels security bugs as `P1`.

## The following are the qualifications for each priority level:

### Priority 1 — P1

A complete business down situation. The client is unable to operate.

### Priority 2 — P2

A major component of the clients ability to operate is affected.  Some aspects of the business can continue but its a major problem.

### Priority 3 — P3

The clients core business is unaffected but the issue is affecting efficient operation by one or more people.

### Priority 4 — P4

The issue is an inconvenience or annoying but there are clear workarounds or alternates.

### Priority 5 — P5

The issue is a background or planned task and will be addressed when time permits or on the planned date.
