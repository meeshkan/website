# Getting started

Welcome <span role="img" aria-label="waving hand">ðŸ‘‹</span> We're stoked that you're an early adopter and trying out Meeshkan. This documentation is here to help guide you through our core concepts and understand what you can expect.

If you have any questions, you can always [contact us for support](/contact/).

**In this section:**

- [What does Meeshkan do?](#what-does-meeshkan-do)
- [Authorizing Meeshkan on GitHub](#authorizing-meeshkan-on-github)
- [How Meeshkan reports bugs](#how-meeshkan-reports-bugs)
- [Revoking access](#revoking-access)

## What does Meeshkan do?

Meeshkan is a machine learning-powered testing and mocking tool. It's built to handle APIs and third-party dependencies.

Once installed, Meeshkan runs weekly and submits issues to your repository when it finds bugs.

## Authorizing Meeshkan on GitHub

To run the tests, Meeshkan must gain permission to access your repository code. To do this, we use an [OAuth app](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/).

The following link will take you through an authorization flow to install Meeshkan:

<Button
  as={UniversalLink}
  variantColor="red"
  rounded="sm"
  fontWeight={900}
  mt={4}
  to="https://github.com/apps/meeshkan/installations/new"
>
  Install Meeshkan
</Button>

Here's what that'll look like if you substitute `Unmock` for your organization name:

After this, you'll land on our success page <span role="img" aria-label="party popper">ðŸŽ‰</span>

## How Meeshkan reports bugs

Meeshkan runs [property-based tests](/docs/faq/#what-is-property-based-testing) on your repository and reports any bugs discovered in the process.

When Meeshkan finds a bug, your Meeshkan testing branch check will link to the test in question. This issue will outline which command found the bug, the response, and, in some cases, a [suggestion for how to resolve it](/docs/how-meeshkan-works/#suggested-fixes).

If no bugs were found, you won't hear anything.

Here's an example issue filed by the Meeshkan GitHub bot (anonymized for privacy):

## Revoking access

You can revoke Meeshkan's access to your repository any time in your [GitHub Applications settings](https://github.com/settings/applications).

![Screenshot from the GitHub Applications Settings page. Meeshkan is at the top and the cursor is hovered over the Revoke action.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26869552/81219329-f474dd80-8fdf-11ea-90a0-b0e65c59733e.png)

Although we'd definitely prefer if you [contacted us first](/contact/). We might be able to help!
