# GitHub App Permissions

Below, you'll find a description of the GitHub app permissions we ask for and why we ask for them.

**In this section:**

- [Content](#content)
- [Issues](#issues)
- [Metadata](#metadata)
- [Pull requests](#pull-requests)
- [Commit statuses](#commit-statuses)

## Content

Meeshkan needs read-access to the content of repositories in order to run automated builds and tests.

## Issues

To report issues, Meeshkan uses a variety of channels, including posting to github issues. An example of this can be seen [here](https://github.com/labsai/EDDI/issues/217).

## Metadata

We use metadata to display information like your repository's name and your organizations avatar.

## Pull requests

For some issues, Meeshkan is able to propose automatic pull requests that will fix them. To do this, we need the ability to submit pull requests to repositories.

## Commit statuses

We use commit statuses to provide useful information directly in the GitHub UI, including on pull requests and on the front page of repositories.
