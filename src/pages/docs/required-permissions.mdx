# GitHub App Permissions

When you authorize the Meeshkan Github app, a brief dialog appears outlining the permissions we ask for. Each permission has its own name and meaning as described in their [api documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/permissions/). Below, you'll find a description of the GitHub app permissions we ask for. We'll use the same terminology as the api documentation, and we'll explain why we ask for each permission.

> Throughout this page, "we" indicates work done by our team and "Meeshkan" for tasks carried out by our GitHub app.

- [Issues - read and write access](#issues)
- [Metadata - read access](#metadata)
- [Pull requests - read access](#pull-requests)
- [Commit statuses - read and write access](#commit-statuses)

## Content

Meeshkan needs read-access to the content of repositories in order to run [automated builds and tests](./how-meeshkan-works).

## Issues

To report issues, Meeshkan uses a variety of channels, including posting to github issues. An example of this can be seen [here](https://github.com/labsai/EDDI/issues/217).

## Metadata

We use metadata to display information, like your repositories' name or organization's avatar, in our [webapp](https://app.meeshkan.com/).

## Pull requests

The Meeshkan pull request permission is deprecated and unused. It will be removed in a future version of the application.

## Commit statuses

We use commit statuses to provide useful information directly in the GitHub UI, including on pull requests and on the front page of repositories.
